Hello, you. :wave:
-----

I'm Erik, and this is a GitHub profile. I did not invent GitHub, definitely did not [invent Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds), but I did create this README which is far less exciting and does not warrant [the creation of a Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Desjardins). 

[Narcity Media](https://www.narcitymedia.com/whoweare) is an awesome company that takes good care of its employees. I'm part of Narcity Media. Therefore, I take good care of my employees. If you're amazing at developing with web technologies, but are treated like you're `/dev/null`, apply :arrow_right: [right here](https://www.narcitymedia.com/careers) :arrow_left:. 

I'm from Canada Montreal, speak French & English, and can type 121 words per minute. Passionate about Linux, security, and the open source community.

## Motivations
As a kid, I was young. Now, I'm still young, but with a receding hairline. I have lived a total of 29 years on this planet, but it's the only planet I've ever lived on. üåç I believe it's important to take of it. üåç That's why I always make sure we use a ridiculously small amount of electricity to achieve greatness. Performance is perceivable. Users love 'em fast websites.

Can't say I've always been into development. Actually that is totally untrue. 

Here's a super cute picture of my dad and I at 11 **days** old.

## Backstory
First programming languages I've learned are C++ and Ruby. [RPG Maker](https://www.rpgmakerweb.com/) made me want to get better at programming so that I could finish my exciting RPG nobody will nor should ever play. Founded my first company while studying computer programming in CEGEP. CEGEP is a weird step in the Canadian education system. I loved it.

Then did a couple years of university in engineering at two different universities, but ended up dropping because I love chemistry and physics, but am terrified by the idea of studying it. 

Began working as a solo player, creating systems for small & medium businesses, fixing bugs online, and contributing to a couple open source projects. 

Invested in [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/fr/). Made a [few dollars](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin). Met with [MTL Blog](https://www.mtlblog.com/). Offered my services. Hired interns from university. Created a CMS. Hired people. Now I'm Chief ~Memes~ Technology Officer.
